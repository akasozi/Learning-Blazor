## INTRODUCTION
Lets C# Software Engineers build web applications with their skills in C# and Microsoft.NET Developers can build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with common languages, frameworks and tools.

- Accelerate app development.
- Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.

### What is Blazor? - 
Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components using C#, HTML and CSS developers can build client and server code with C#.
- They can also share code and libraries between the frontend client code and backend logic

You can use Blazor to generate:
- Server-side code that handles UI interactions over a WebSocket connection.
- A client-side web app that runs directly in the browser via WebAssembly.

### What is WebAssembly(WASM)?
- Its an open binary standard 
- It defines a portable code format for programs designed to run in web browsers
- WebAssembly is a textual assembly language with a compact binary format for fast downloads and near-native performance.
- WebAssembly provides a compilation target for languages such as C, C++, and Rust.
- It's designed to run alongside JavaScript so that both work together
- WebAssembly also can generate progressive web applications to be downloaded and run offline.
