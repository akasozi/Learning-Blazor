# A BLAZING JOURNEY
To run on mac download the .net software development kit

use the command below to create a new blazor application

    dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorApp --no-https

To run the application run the command 

    dotnet watch
    
### Observations    
1. .razor file contains both @page directive, Html, and @code directive 
2. The .razor file name is the name of the component, a component has the @code annotation
3. Properties are referenced using the @ annotation    
    
## INTRODUCTION
Lets C# Software Engineers build web applications with their skills in C# and Microsoft.NET Developers can build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with common languages, frameworks and tools.

- Accelerate app development.
- Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.

### What is Blazor? - 
Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components using C#, HTML and CSS developers can build client and server code with C#.
- They can also share code and libraries between the frontend client code and backend logic

You can use Blazor to generate:
- Server-side code that handles UI interactions over a WebSocket connection.
- A client-side web app that runs directly in the browser via WebAssembly.

### What is WebAssembly(WASM)?
- Its an open binary standard 
- It defines a portable code format for programs designed to run in web browsers
- WebAssembly is a textual assembly language with a compact binary format for fast downloads and near-native performance.
- WebAssembly provides a compilation target for languages such as C, C++, and Rust.
- It's designed to run alongside JavaScript so that both work together
- WebAssembly also can generate progressive web applications to be downloaded and run offline.

### What is Blazor WebAssembly?
- With Blazor WebAssembly, developers can run .NET code in a browser.
- It's a single-page app framework and uses the WebAssembly open standards without requiring plug-ins or code generation.
- .NET code executed via WebAssembly in a browser runs in the browser's JavaScript sandbox.

- Blazor uses a .NET runtime compiled to a WebAssembly module that is downloaded with an app.
- The module can execute .NET Standard code included in a Blazor app.
- A Blazor WebAssembly app is restricted to the capabilities of the browser that executes the app. But the app can access full browser functionality via JavaScript interop

### What is Blazor Server?
- Blazor Server provides support for hosting Razor components on the server in an ASP.NET Core app.
- UI updates are handled over a SignalR connection.
- The runtime stays on the server and handles:
- Executing the app's C# code.
- - Sending UI events from the browser to the server.
- - Applying UI updates to the rendered component that are sent back by the server.
- The connection used by Blazor Server to communicate with the browser is also used to handle JavaScript interop calls.

- A client-side web app that runs directly in the browser via WebAssembly.

Use the command below to create a new Blazor Project in a directory of your choice

    dotnet new blazorserver -f net6.0
- Boom 

## Data binding and events  

- In a Blazor app, you can add C# code in separate .cs files or inline in your Razor components.

## What are Razor directives?
- Razor directives are component markup used to add C# inline with HTML. 
- With directives, developers can define single statements, methods, or larger code blocks.  

## Code directives
- You can use @expression() to add a C# statement inline with HTML.
- If you require more code, use the @code directive to add multiple statements enclosed by parentheses.
- You can also add an @functions section to the template for methods and properties. 

## Page directive
- The @Page directive is special markup that identifies a component as a page. 
- Use this directive to specify a route. 


## Razor data binding
- Within Razor components, you can data bind HTML elements to C# fields, properties, and Razor expression values. 
- Data binding allows two-way synchronization between HTML and Microsoft .NET.
- Data is pushed from HTML to .NET when a component is rendered. 
- Components render themselves after event-handler code executes. 
- That's why property updates are reflected in the UI immediately after an event handler is triggered.
- Use @bind markup to bind a C# variable to an HTML object.
- You define the C# variable by name as a string in the HTML.

## PRACTICAL 

To Create a new razor component use the command below

     dotnet new razorcomponent -n Todo -o Pages

A razor component called Todo is created in the Pages directory
